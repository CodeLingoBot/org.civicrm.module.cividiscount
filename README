A prototype for CMS independent extensions. Porting civievent_discount to this framework

Known issues:

1. Tracking: Participant ID is not available in postProcess() for offline contribution.
2. Tracking: Need to register URL for snippet display of usage history per contact/organization.
7. Tracking: Additional testing needed to verify online/offline tracking for events, membership and autodiscounts.
8. Tracking: Verify works correctly when viewing organization record that "owns" the discount code.
10. ignore_case() and allow_multiple() need to be implemented.

Fixed:

3. CRUD: Edit code isn't working.
4. CRUD: Delete code isn't working.
5. CRUD: Returns to wrong page after add/edit/delete (user context?).
6. CRUD: Enable/disable code isn't working.
9. Feature: Pricesets isn't implemented
