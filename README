A prototype for CMS independent extensions. Porting civievent_discount to this framework

Known issues:

1. Tracking: Participant ID is not available in postProcess() for offline contribution.
7. Tracking: Additional testing needed to verify online/offline tracking for events, membership and autodiscounts.

- Feature Adds:

1. ignore_case() and allow_multiple() need to be implemented via CiviCRM settings
2. Implement hook_civicrm_install and hook_civicrm_uninstall for Civi v4.2
3. Fix extensions so that when an extension is installed/uninstalled/enabled/disabled the CiviCRM menu is rebuilt, cache is cleared etc
4. Fix the permission issue. Should we add hook_civicrm_perms and then ensure the CMS rebuilds its permission arrays?
5. Figure out how to handle Views and UC integration
